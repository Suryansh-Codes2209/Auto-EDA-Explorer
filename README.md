# Auto EDA with PyCaret, Pandas Profiling, and Streamlit

This project is an Auto EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) tool that automates the process of analyzing and visualizing a dataset. It uses PyCaret for data preprocessing and modeling, Pandas Profiling for generating comprehensive data reports, and Streamlit for creating a user-friendly frontend.

## Features

- Automatically performs data preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.
- Generates a detailed data report using Pandas Profiling, including summary statistics, variable correlations, and data quality checks.
- Provides interactive visualizations for better data understanding, including histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
- Allows users to select the target variable and perform automated machine learning tasks, such as model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model comparison.
- Offers a user-friendly frontend built with Streamlit, allowing users to easily upload their datasets, customize analysis options, and visualize the results.
